        <h3>CodeCrafters - Build Your Own HTTP Server Project</h3>
        <p>
            This project is part of the CodeCrafters course, where the challenge is to build an HTTP
            server from scratch using only low-level modules. By relying solely on the socket module
            to create the underlying TCP connection, the project emphasizes understanding and
            implementing the core principles of how an HTTP server operates without the help of
            high-level abstractions or frameworks.
